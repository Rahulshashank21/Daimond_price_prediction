# Diamond Price Prediction

![Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/Rahulshashank21/Daimond_price_prediction/assets/124797005/f4a00d85-fda0-4486-90a9-34bfe146ca6e)

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics. The prediction model is deployed using Flask, a Python web framework.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have Python 3 and Flask installed. If you don't have them, you can install them using the following commands:

pip install python
pip install flask

Once you have Python and Flask installed, you can run the project by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the Flask server:

The Flask server will start on port 5000, and you can access the project at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- A machine learning model that predicts the price of a diamond based on its characteristics.
- A Flask web app that allows users to input the characteristics of a diamond and get a prediction of its price.
- A README file that explains the project.
- Automated pipelines for the project.
- The dataset is included in the repository at `artifacts/data/gemstone.csv`.
- The machine learning model is a random forest model with an R2 score of 0.9768893564123389.
- The following machine learning models were also evaluated:
- LinearRegression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- Elasticnet
- DecisionTree
- RandomForest
- KNN
- SVM
- The project also includes a web API that allows you to predict the price of a diamond programmatically.

## To-Do

The project is still under development. Here are some of the things that are planned for the future:

- Improve the accuracy of the machine learning model.
- Add more features to the web app.
- Deploy the project to a production environment.
- Document the web API.
